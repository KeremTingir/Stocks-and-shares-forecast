Turkish Airlines stock forecast 

With the API key you have received, you can pull the data of the stock you want. We pulled the data of Turkish Airlines between 2020 and 2024. 
We extracted the daily data and saved it in a csv file, thus creating our dataset. To better understand the data we generated, we made a visualization and saved our shape in the dataset.
Looking at the dataset, we thought that it could be solved with linear regression and we trained and saved our model and then we did our tests on the saved data.
We have two different model evaluations, the first of which is the estimation based on the last day value of the dataset.
second, a random day is selected from the dataset and a forecast is made based on the next day and compared to the actual value in the dataset.

Updates that can be made on the model:
1) We can expand our dataset even further and pull data on a daily basis and the model can train itself every day to give us a prediction value based on the next day.
2) We can put the model into an interface and make it easier to use, so that we can more easily predict our predictions with notifications.
3) We can narrow down our forecasts to specific ranges and get more accurate short-term results.
